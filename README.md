# TicTacToe-Game

To make TicTacToe game firstly we implement a board elements globally. Firstly we show the board and if we implement something, we can clearly see what we have done so far. 

Board places defined as numbers which are 1 to 9 because we have 9 places to put our X or O s. 

We can organize the functions by this sequence : 

#board

#display board

#play game

#check win

#check rows

#check columns

#check diagonals

#check tie

#flip player


In this way we can easily code step by step and move on for more. We can add some features with this steps easily.
